# popularity-prediction
# This project aimed to do below things:
# 1: Should this recipe be listed?
# 2: What kind of recipes have higher chance to become popular?
Findings:
1) Recipe category is the most influential factor in determining a recipe’s popularity.
2) Vegetable, potato, and pork recipes are positively associated with high traffic, while beverage, breakfast, and chicken recipes tend to receive lower traffic.
3) The fine-tuned RF model achieved 82% accuracy in predicting high-traffic recipes.

Advice:
1) Focus on developing and listing fewer beverage, breakfast, and chicken recipes while expanding vegetable and potato-based recipes.
2) Use the fine-tuned RF model to predict a recipe’s traffic potential before listing new recipes.
